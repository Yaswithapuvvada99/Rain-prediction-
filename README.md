Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict rainfall based on historical weather data. The model can be used to support decision-making in various fields, such as agriculture, urban planning, and emergency management.

Features

Utilizes Extra Trees Classifiers to predict rainfall events
Employs feature engineering techniques to extract relevant features from historical weather data
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Provides visualizations of predicted rainfall patterns using maps and time series plots
Model Architecture

The Extra Trees Classifier model is trained on historical weather data to predict rainfall events. The model architecture is as follows:

Input features: Historical weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
Output feature: Rainfall event (yes/no)
Model parameters:
Number of estimators: 100
Maximum depth: 23
Random state: 42
Performance Metrics

The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: 0.80
Precision: 0.87
Recall: 0.89
F1-score: 0.88
Result

Hence predicted whether there is rainfall or not.
